RT cosmo application management aka RLX3 starter
------------------------------------------------

Overview
~~~~~~~~

The purpose of this document is to create a proposal for the RT cosmo
application management /start, stop, restart, etc/.

Find below the current state and the proposals for the RT cosmo
application management.

Current state
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The RT cosmo application is managed by `rlx3-starter` as depicted in the
figure below.

components]

Systemd runs RLX3 starter. Afterwards RLX3 starter fires `start.sh`
script which basically starts the RT cosmo application.

This solution ends up with the following processes on the system.

tree]

Drawbacks
^^^^^^^^^

* daemonize package is required
* several process are running on top of the RT cosmo application
* service unit file is separated from the RT cosmo application

Proposal #1 - remove daemonize
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The RT cosmo application is managed by `rlx3-starter` as depicted in the
figure below. The only difference is that the `daemonize` package is not
used anymore.

This solution ends up with the following processes on the system.

tree]

Drawbacks
^^^^^^^^^

* several process are running on top of the RT cosmo application
* service unit file is separated from the RT cosmo application

Proposal #2 - remove rlx3-starter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The RT cosmo application is managed directly by `systemd` as depicted in
the figure below.

This solution ends up with the following processes on the system.

process tree]

Drawbacks
^^^^^^^^^

* customer must integrate the service unit file to the RT cosmo
application

Impacts
^^^^^^^

* rlx3-starter is completely removed
* ExecStartPre script might be created from scratch
